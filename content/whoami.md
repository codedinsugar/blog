I am an Engineer at heart.  I respect the symbiant circle of simplicity and complexity for the IT field of practice.  Although our industry has seen a paradigm shift to the Cloud, I am grateful to have been part of the preceeding movement.  Working with physical equipment on-premise brings a tangible sense of fulfillment.  The best commit one can push is to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.

My experience listed below is simply a high level summary of things I've enjoyed doing.

TL;DR

"I want to build really cool stuff to solve problems and make life a better place."
